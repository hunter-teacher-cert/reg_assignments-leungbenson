All components of the lesson are in the slide notes.

Feedback:

The major feedback I was given was that I was too detailed in my lesson.  I walked the students through every line of code in the lesson.  As a result, the change I made was to make the lesson more discovery based.  I had the students do more exploration and play around with the code.  Instead of me telling my students what the parameters of the functions did, they changed the parameters themselves and discussed how that affects the program.
