## Census Data Project
### Benson Leung

Students will collect data from their classmates using Google Form.  They will create 4 unique questions to ask. They will export this data into Google Sheets and analyze the data by writings down their noticings. Finally, they'll summarize their noticings and data on a shared Google Slide and provide feedback to each other.
