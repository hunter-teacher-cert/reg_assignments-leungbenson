  # Equity Grading
  ## Benson Leung
  *   Listen to the following podcast on grading (35 minutes): https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/15/season-2-episode-4-grading-for-equity/
  * In a markdown document, provide your reaction to the suggestions made in the episode.
    - Do you agree with the general sentiment or not?
    - Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
  * For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

I do agree with the general statement in a sense that grading should be mastery based rather than just comleting assignments.  I do like the idea that students shouldn't be punished for submitting late work.  But in the same breath, it is realistiscally difficult to grade with the current marking period system.  Time is a limited asset and time limits should be set.  I personally believe that participation should be graded because we don;t only teach content.  We teach SEL along with life skills.  Students should learn how to contribute to society and participation is a way of doing so.  An alternative is to have a separate grade for participation and one for mastery.

I feel like I already implemented some of this system in my enrichment classes.  The students know they're not getting graded for this class and even if they do, the grades won't count against their GPA.  I feel that I built a culture of respect in my classroom, so my students do the work because they know it will help them.  Until my school implements a standards based grading system, I can see it being very difficult to stray away from points-based system.
