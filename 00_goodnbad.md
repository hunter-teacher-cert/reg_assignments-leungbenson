1. Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.
    - Why do you think it didnâ€™t go well?
    - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
    
    After teaching one of my enrichment classes my recorded lesson, I tried to teach my other enrichment class the same lesson.  It started off well with everyone listening attentively.  Once we got to the activity where everyone is trying to get their partner out the door, it all broke down.  
    Students were either ramming into each other or not doing the activity at all.  I think part of the reason was that I may not have made my expectations clear enough.  Therefore, next time I would have them set up on the board beforehand.
    Another reason could've been that this was a class of 33 where a third of them have IEPs and since this is an enrichment class, a SPED teacher was not required.  I could've used more support in this class.
    
2. Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.
    - Why do you think it went so well?

  For the recorded lesson I taught last semester, I felt that the lesson went really well.  All the students were very engaged and excited to learn.  They all participated in the activity and completed their tasks.
  I think part of the reason is that I came in with a very positive mindset and the students felt that.  I let them know this is something new and I am very excited about teaching it and they were able to reciprocate that feeling.
  I made the lesson fun by having them do something they've always wanted to do, get the teacher out of class.  Then they were able to see how this is applied in programming.
