### Assignment - Benson Leung
  * title: **think_different.md**
  * Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
    - Anything else you deem important
   
### 1) Flipped Classroom
  - In this strategy, students are given the lesson as a homework assignment so that they come into class with the knowledge of the topic beforehand.
  - They will be given a quick assessment, similar to an entrance ticket, i the beginning of class.
  - This will be used to create their groups based on their results.
  - Highest scoring group will be given the coding activity with extensions.
  - Middle scoring group will be given the coding activity.
  - Lowest scoring group will form a small group with the teacher.
  - If majority scores low, then a reteach of topic will be necessary.
  - Goal is to provide students with learning freedom.


### 2) Misconception Grouping:
- In this strategy, a list of misconceptions would be created beforehand.
- While doing the group/individual activity, teacher will be recording which students are making which misconceptions.
- After list is compiled, students will be grouped into stationsbased on those misconceptions.
- They will do an activity that covers that misconception.
- Afterwards, they will go back to the main activity and fix their program based on what they just learned.
- The goal of this strategy is to give everyone an opportunity to work on skills they are either lacking or forgetting in.
  
### 3) Important, Neat, and Tough
- In this strategy, students are given different levels of the coding activity.
- The main topic/skill that all students need to have will be labeled Important.
- The next level up will be labeled Neat.
- The hardest level will be labeled Tough.
- There could be optional grouping, but this works well individually.
- Students are given  a choice on which level they wish to attempt, but they must complete at least the Important level.
- This provides more advanced students with challenges and won't overwhelm those are who not as advanced.
